      <h3>Container Objects</h3>

        <p>
        What if we wanted to build a program that would act as a database of information? How would we access the information? Ruby arranges collections of objects with <em>container objects</em>. The two predominant container objects are arrays and hashes.
        </p>

      <h3>Arrays</h3>

        <p>
        Arrays are numerically ordered lists of objects. Starting from the index 0, every added element is stored in order and accessed as such. Arrays can store any object as an indexed element.
        </p>

      <h3>Hashes</h3>

        <p>
        Hashes, like arrays are also ordered lists. However, hashes are indexed by 'keys' to access their values. This relationship is known as a 'key-value pair.' Any object can be used as a key to access a value, which can also be any object.
        </p>

      <h3>Arrays vs. Hashes</h3>

        <p>
        Coming back to the question of how we would access the information of a database, when would we use arrays and when would we use hashes? Let's say we want to build a dictionary. If we use an array, each word would have to be stored in numerical order. To access a word, we would have to go through every number until we find the word. In this case, we would want to use a hash. To find out the definition of 'coir' we would just use the key 'coir' to access the value 'fiber from the outer husk of a coconut.' This way is much more efficient than looking through each numbered element of an array. However, let's say we're hosting a race, and we want to write a program that will store in order each person's name that crosses the finish line. Since we are dealing with an ordered list of strings, it would be simpler to use an array than a hash.

        <h2>What are Version control, Git, and Github?</h2>
        Before version control, you would write your code, save it occasionally, and then save it one last time before closing. But, what if you made a mistake earlier and already saved a number of times? You might have to go through lines and lines of code to be able to fix the problem. Version control addresses this issue by saving your saves and modifications into a log, so you can track them and go back to them. With each save, you create a checkpoint that you can go back to, if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git is the most popular version control system. When a user modifies a file, Git tracks the change and gives the the option to save or "commit." The checkpoint is then stored in a Git "repository," a subfolder that holds the file's checkpoints. The committed change, then, becomes logged and available for revisiting.
      </p>

        Version control shines, however, when collaboration is involved, when Github comes into play. Github is a website that acts as a remote repository. When multiple people want to work on one file, they can each get an exact copy of the "master" version that is stored in Github. Users branch their work from the Github master branch and "push" their local commits to Github when they are done with their work. This way, the one master version can remain safe from changes not yet agreed upon.

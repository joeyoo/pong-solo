        <p>
          Ruby on Rails is one of the software libraries available for Ruby. It was created for the purpose of giving structure to the web-app building process. As a framework, Rails is 'opinionated,' meaning it assumes and establishes 'best' practices. And, since we're dealing with the web, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are still involved. Rails organizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a standardized directory and uses the power of Ruby to create shared compartments of web files. Features like these are reinforced by the continuous, open involvement of the Rails community. Most likely, someone has already built most of the features you would want.

        <p>
          Don't mistake Rails as a product of laziness, at least not it's nature as a complete process. Rails lets you think bigger and smaller by integrating abstraction and organization. It compartmentalizes everything for seamless zooming in to make little changes and zooming out to make those changes bigger.

I feel pretty comfortable with seeing and adjusting the padding, borders, and margin. Seeing the box layout in Chrome Devtools helped me learn how to position my html elements where I wanted them. I struggled with positioning the elements without resorting to fixing the positions with pixel numbers. However, I did learn and utilize html5 elements with CSS fixed positioning. I found it easier implementing features while I struggled with positioning them without the use of trial and error.
